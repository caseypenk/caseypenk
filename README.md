Welcome!

My name is Casey Penk and I'm a full-stack web developer with a focus on creating minimalist user interfaces and experiences. I utilize JavaScript, React, Express, Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, and Sass. I also have experience implementing applications with C++, Java, and PHP.

I'm currently a student in the Advanced Software Engineering Immersive at Hack Reactor. I'm seeking a full-stack or front-end software engineering position to begin in November 2022. If you would like to discuss further, feel free to reach out at caseypenk [at] gmail [dot] com.
